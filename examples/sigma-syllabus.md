## Overview

Welcome to Prime! We're very excited to launch your new career as full stack software engineers. It's going to take a lot of work to get there and we're going to be covering a lot of ground very quickly. Not all content or topics are listed here. Many topics will come up ad-hoc in class and range across communication, professionalism, best practices, computer science/theory, tools, and tangential topics developers need to be aware of.

The in-class portion of Prime is broken into the following two tiers:

### Tier 2

The second tier is a concentrated blast of programming know-how with MEAN stack web development technologies. It is lecture and assignment-heavy and the schedule is fast-paced and fairly rigid. Context may flex across weeks based on cohort readiness.

**Week 1** - JavaScript review, Git, Terminal commands, jQuery and DOM manipulation, Forms.

**Week 2** - HTML/CSS, jQuery and AJAX (Introduction to Client -> Server communication).

**Week 3** - Server-side JS: Node, NPM, Express framework, Heroku hosting platform. Tying together client and server code.

**Week 4** - Advanced Node/Express, SQL Databases, using APIs, PUT/DELETE requests.

**Week 5** - Angular: directives, modules, client-side routing, data banding. MongoDB, Advanced Git.

**Week 6** - Angular services, user authentication, session/token management, ES6.

### Daily Schedule

During Tier 2, our daily schedule will roughly follow this pattern every day:

- Settle in, talk code with peers, share knowledge
- Lecture or code walkthrough
- Activity (group, peer, or solo)
- Lecture/Activity, assign homework challenge

### Weekly Schedule

The weeks will have the following pattern:

- **Monday:** Walkthrough of weekend challenge, Code Challenge on previous week's content, assign weekly speech topic.
- **Tuesday:** Tech and soft skills lectures, solo/peer challenges/activities.
- **Wednesday & Thursday:** Tech and soft skills lectures, Group or solo challenges, Toastmasters, give speeches.
- **Friday:** - Speeches wrap up, review of week's content, solo challenges, walkthroughs, weekend challenge overview.

### Weekly Code Challenges

The Weekly Code Challenge is a timed, solo, open-notes/open-internet code challenge intended to help us gauge how well the previous week's content has sunk in. It is the start of a conversation, nothing more.

## Tier 3

This tier focuses on applying your knowledge across two full stack apps, building yourself a small portfolio in the meantime. Lecture is more flexible and tailored to practical needs.

**Weeks 7 – 8: Solo project work** - Lectures on development tools, project management, practical advanced topics such as ORM, Less/Sass, Grunt/Gulp.
**Weeks 9 – 12: Group project work** - Real world client-directed project. Lectures on interviewing, JavaScript recap, advanced topics such as Angular Material, Heroku Add-Ons, Deployment and Technical Interviewing skills.

## Final Week

The final Wednesday includes group presentations of your group project to clients and colleagues. Following the presentations you will have a round of first interviews with representatives from our hiring network. Only those with actual job openings will be present.

We also review JavaScript topics so you are ready to talk about the language at a deep level during technical interviews and interview code challenges.

**Graduation Day is Friday, January 27th**

## Policies

### Attendance

Consistent attendance is critical to your success at Prime. Tier 2 lectures occur every day and are not repeated. Group and solo activities are likewise very important and not repeated. Work can be made up as long as you communicate with your instructors.

If you are going to miss a day, please email [sigma-instructors@primeacademy.io](mailto:sigma-instructors@primeacademy.io) or Slack us directly.

### Daily Feedback

Prime is an intense experience and we want to make sure you get all the support you need.

Therefore, the daily feedback form is mandatory. Without this information we cannot hope to keep up with how you're feeling during prime. This feedback is crucial to your development and takes very little time to complete.
