# Navigating Text Using the Keyboard on macOS

A few months ago, Merlin Mann [tweeted a link](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/760580445213831168) to the [Apple Support document on Mac keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236). There's a ton of great tricks in there, but what I want to focus on are the ones related to editing text documents.

I've selected just the shortcuts I find most useful, and reposted them below. If you work with text at all on a Mac — code, prose, spreadsheets, whatever — these will *seriously* step up your game.

*Note: I've used glyphs for the shortcut keys so as to better fit them in the table. If you're unfamiliar with any of the symbols, I've provided a key at the bottom of the post.*

| Shortcut           | Description                                                              |

| `⌥ + ⌫`            | Delete the word to the left of the cursor.                               |
| `Fn + ⌫`           | Forward Delete on keyboards that don't have a Forward Delete (⌦) key.    |
| `⌃ + K`            | Delete the text between the cursor and the end of the line or paragraph. |
| `Fn + ↑` or `↓`    | Scroll up or down one page.                                              |
