# Markdown [Mâ†“]

This project created as my "technology presentation" to the class.

Markdown was invented by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, and was intended to be a simple and light markup language, focusing on readability.

Checkout [GitHub's Markdown Guide][1] for more information on the syntax. It's a great reference.
